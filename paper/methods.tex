In this section we review the data we collected for the City of Chicago and the
methods we used to cluster Chicago's census tracts into priority areas for solar
panel distribution. We used the hazard-exposure-vulnerability framework asserted
by the \ac{ipcc} to categorize the datasets used in this work
\cite{viner_understanding_2020,field_determinants_2012}.

\subsection{Hazard}

Hazards are the climate-related events the may lead to adverse outcomes for people,
such as losses of life, function, property, infrastructure, and resources
\cite{viner_understanding_2020}. In this work, we focus on the risk of heat stress
and the potential for heat-related deaths, for which temperature is the primary
hazard. We gathered hourly temperature data for each community area in Chicago for the
years 2000 to 2020 using the \ac{nsrdb} \cite{sengupta_national_2018}. In order
to capture the temperature difference among Chicago's community areas during heatwaves,
we set a temperature threshold of 32$^\circ$C and filtered out the data below this
threshold. We defined a heatwave temperature anomaly,
\begin{eqnarray}
  H_a = T_{ca} - T_{city},
\end{eqnarray}
where $T_{ca}$ is the temperature of the community area and $T_{city}$ is the
mean temperature of the city (i.e. the mean of all community areas), in celsius.
We then took the mean of the hourly $H_a$ to use in our clustering algorithm.
Figure \ref{fig:ha_map} shows the variations in temperature during heatwaves in
Chicago.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:ha_map}

      \caption{The temperature variations among community areas in Chicago during
      heatwaves. Higher values indicate warmer temperatures than the city mean
      temperature and lower values indicate cooler temperatures.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

A positive $H_a$ indicates regions that experience higher temperatures during
heatwaves and a negative $H_a$ indicates regions with lower heatwave temperatures,
with respect to the citywide average temperature.
The region near O'Hare International Airport experiences the highest temperatures,
nearly 2$^\circ$C above the citywide average. The temperature anomalies are further
adjusted by subtracting the minimum temperature difference such that the
coolest area of the city has an $\bar{H_a}$ value of zero and other values indicate
the temperature above this minimum value. This is done to ensure good behavior
from the clustering process.

\subsection{Exposure}

Exposure is the presence of people or important assets in places that could be
adversely affected by climate hazards \cite{viner_understanding_2020}.

\subsection{Vulnerability}

Vulnerabilities are the factors that predispose certain groups or areas to adverse
outcomes. We consider several physical and social vulnerabilities. Studies that
mapped heat stress and heatwave risk tend to focus on weather effects (hazards)
alone \cite{dahl_killer_2019, kang_heatwave-related_2020,mazdiyasni_heat_2019,
cotlier_extreme_2022}. One study incorporated a hazard-exposure-vulnerability
framework by treating land use and building purpose as proxies for exposure and
vulnerability, along with population age \cite{maragno_mapping_2020}. Conversely,
studies that map the disparities in solar panel distribution do so along a social
axis, without climate differences.


\subsubsection{Energy Burden}

Energy burden is the ratio of household energy costs to household income. We created
a map of energy burden in Chicago using data from \ac{cejst}
\cite{council_on_environmental_quality_climate_nodate}. Energy
burden affects access to electricity, especially during heatwaves when demand
and cost of electricity are highest. Rooftop solar panels can reduce energy costs
and therefore improve access to cooling during heatwaves. Figure \ref{fig:eb} shows
the distribution of energy burden throughout Chicago.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \label{fig:eb}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{energy_burden}
      \vspace*{-2cm}
      \caption{Energy burden throughout Chicago as a percentile. A region in the zeroth
      percentile has the least energy burden and a region in the 100th percentile has
      more energy burden than any other region.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tree Canopy}

Urban tree cover effectively mitigate land surface temperatures in cities
\cite{loughner_roles_2012, schwaab_role_2021, mcdonald_tree_2021}. Tree canopy
reduces temperature by preventing ground heat storage through shade and encouraging
evapotranspiration \cite{mcdonald_tree_2021}. Thus, areas with greater tree cover
are less vulnerable heatwaves. Figure \ref{fig:tree_census} shows the distribution
of trees in Chicago from the Morton Arboretum Tree Census \cite{kua_chicago_2020}.

      \vspace*{-2cm}
      \caption{Distribution of trees in Chicago by percentile. A region in the zeroth
      percentile has the least tree canopy and a region in the 100th percentile has
      more tree cover than any other region.}
