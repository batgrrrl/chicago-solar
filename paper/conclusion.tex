Limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item we implicitly weight vulnerability factors higher than hazard or exposure since we have more of those data points.
  \item the heatwave temperature anomaly does not factor in duration in the definition
  of heatwave.
  \item we only consider temperature as a heatwave hazard. Other climatic factors
  may influence the effect of heatwaves and heat stress on the human body. Such as
  humidity.
\end{enumerate}

The argument advanced in this work is that prioritizing the distribution of solar
panels offered by programs like Solar for All or Illinois Shines will minimize the
overall heat-related adversity. Current standards for prioritizing beneficiaries
of these programs do not account for climate hazards such as heatwaves nor the
many vulnerabilities that, together, create a holistic understanding of risk.
